# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the player to compete against a computer opponent. The computer opponent is powered by a minimax algorithm, making it challenging to win.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against the computer.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic UI**: The game interface updates to show the current game state and announces the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can easily reset the game and start a new one.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including player moves, checking for a winner, and computer AI using the minimax algorithm.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the game interface.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the game interface.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, event handlers, and AI implementation.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. The player is always "O" and starts first.
3. Click on any empty box to place your "O".
4. The computer will automatically make its move as "X".
5. The game continues until there is a winner or the game ends in a draw.
6. To play again, click the "New Game" button or use the "Reset Game" button to reset the current game state.

## Future Improvements

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow two players to play on the same device.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Implement different levels of difficulty for the computer opponent.
- **Animations**: Add animations for smoother transitions between game states.
